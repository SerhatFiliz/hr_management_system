HR Management System This project is a web application that enables HR employees to create job postings on behalf of their affiliated companies, manage candidate profiles who apply for these positions, and automate business processes through AI integration. The system is built on a secure authentication infrastructure and an authorization mechanism that ensures each user can only access their own company's data.

‚ú® Key Features

    User Management: Secure registration and login system for HR employees.
    
    Dynamic Company Management: During registration, if the mentioned company does not exist in the database, it is created automatically; if it exists, it is associated with the existing one.
    
    Authorization: Each user can only view and manage the job postings and candidate profiles belonging to their own company.
    
    Job Posting Management: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for job postings on behalf of the company.
    
    Candidate Profile Management: Creation and listing of profiles for job applicants, including name, surname, email, and resume (PDF).
    
    Secure File Management: Resumes are accepted only in PDF format and stored securely on the server.
    
    AI Integration (Optional): After entering a job description, an AI API like Gemini can be called with a single click to automatically generate the most suitable job title.
